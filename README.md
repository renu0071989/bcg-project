# bcg-project

This project aims to investigate whether customers' price sensitivity is a driving factor for churn. 
To test this hypothesis, the project proposes to model the churn probabilities of customers and 
derive the effect of prices on churn rates. 
To build the models, the project would need three types of data: customer data, churn data, and historical price data 
for both electricity and gas at granular time intervals. 
Once the data is obtained, the project proposes to define and calculate price sensitivity, 
engineer features based on the data, and build a binary classification model 
(such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosted Machines). 
The best model would be selected based on the tradeoff between complexity, explainability, and accuracy. 
The project would then analyze the impact of price changes on churn and assess the business impact of the 
client's proposed discounting strategy using the model.
